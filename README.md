# Sorting_algorithms
There are several sorting algorithms for data in an array or a list and each have their own time complexity calculations. Big O notation is the time complexity calculation that approximates the average time taken by an algorithm to sort a given set of data. We needed to implement three sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.Here's an overview of each task:

**Task 0: Bubble Sort**

Implement the bubble_sort function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm. The function prototype is as follows:

void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);

**Task 1: Insertion Sort**

Implement the insertion_sort_list function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm. The function prototype is as follows:

void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);

**Task 2: Selection Sort**

Implement the selection_sort function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm. The function prototype is as follows:

void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);

Note: The time complexities (big O notations) for the sorting algorithms are as follows:

***Bubble Sort:***

Best case: O(n)

Average case: O(n^2)

Worst case: O(n^2)

***Insertion Sort:***

Best case: O(n)

Average case: O(n^2)

Worst case: O(n^2)

***Selection Sort:***

Best case: O(n^2)

Average case: O(n^2)

Worst case: O(n^2)
